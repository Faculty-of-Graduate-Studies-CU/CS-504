# CS-504
Welcome to the **CS504 Logical Gate Repository**! This repository is dedicated to exploring the fundamentals of **logical gates** and their applications in digital circuits and computer systems. Whether you're a student, educator, this repository provides a collection of resources, code examples, and projects to help you with logical gates.
## üìÇ Repository Contents

The repository is structured to include the following:
- **Theory and Notes**: Detailed explanations of logical gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) and their truth tables.
- **Simulations**: Code and scripts for simulating logical gates using tools like Python, Verilog, or circuit simulators.
- **Projects**: Practical projects demonstrating the use of logical gates in building circuits (e.g., adders, multiplexers, flip-flops).
- **Resources**: Supplementary materials such as textbooks, research papers, and tutorials on digital logic design.
- **Code Examples**: Sample implementations of logical gates in various programming languages and hardware description languages (HDLs).

## üéØ Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Provide a comprehensive resource for learning about logical gates and their applications.
- Offer hands-on examples and projects to reinforce theoretical concepts.
- Support students and educators in teaching and learning digital logic design.
